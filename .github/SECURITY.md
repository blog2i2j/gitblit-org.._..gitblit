## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Gitblit team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.


To report a security vulnerability, you can use the Github mechanism to [privately report a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). On Gitblit's repository page, choose the `Security` tab (under the repository name). Click the `Report a vulnerability` button on the right. 

Alternatively, you can also report any security issue via e-mail. Send an email to the following email address and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.
